PROJECT 3 README FILE

PURPOSE:

	Build a program for scheduling student orientation using
	the Builder Pattern. The Pattern first creates the variable
	of base class type, which holds the reference to the subclass
	and the eNums representing the parameters. This then gets 
	passed to the builder which creates the concrete final object.
